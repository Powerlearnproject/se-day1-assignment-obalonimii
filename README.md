3. Design
During the design phase, developers outline how the software will function and what technologies will be used. This includes defining system architecture, user interfaces, and data structures. Prototyping may also occur at this stage to visualize aspects of the application, ensuring that it meets user needs before moving on to coding.
4. Development (Coding)
In this phase, developers write code based on the design specifications. The coding process involves translating design documents into a functional software application using chosen programming languages and tools. This stage is often the longest, as it requires collaboration among multiple developers to ensure consistency and quality.
5. Testing
After coding is complete, the testing phase begins. Quality assurance teams test the software for bugs and verify that it meets all specified requirements. This may involve various testing methods, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. The goal is to identify and fix any issues before deployment35.
6. Deployment
Once testing is successfully completed, the software is deployed to a production environment where end-users can access it. This phase may include additional training for users and documentation to assist them in using the new software effectively.
7. Maintenance
The final phase involves ongoing support and maintenance of the software after deployment. This includes fixing any bugs that arise, implementing updates for new features, and ensuring compatibility with changing technologies or user needs.
